This public folder is source code for the front-end client side, javascript, CSS framework components 
(like react), or any other source code that controls the front end (other API's).


Files in src are processed (e.g., compiled or bundled) before being passed to the browser. The TypeScript/JavaScript logic is here and Webpack or Vite bundle these files for deployment. (this just means these are prepared here
before being sent to the public folder)
